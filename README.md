# SlotsBypass
Bypass your player slots/limit with a permission.
 
How it works:
 
You put the .jar file in your server, then restart the server.
You are going to search for the map ''Bypassslots''..
Then you're gonna open the file ''config.yml''.
And there you can edit the bypass permission for players.
After you changed the file/permission you can restart your server.
I recommend using PermissionsEx or LuckPerms if you use a perm plugin, it doesn't realy matter it already works.
Auto permission: ''bypass.slots'' - Prefix and all other changes can be set by your choice.
